\subsection{Proof of completeness of the symbolic handling semantics}
\begin{proof}

  We prove Lemma~\ref{lem:completeHandle} by induction over the derivation $t,\sigma\handle{i}t',\sigma'$.

  \case{\refrule{H-Change}}
  {
  By the SH-Change rule, we have $\Edit v,\sigma\simhandle\Edit s,\sims,s,\True$, and $s\sim v'$ holds by definition of input simulation.
  }

  \case{\refrule{H-Fill}}
  {
    By the SH-Fill rule, we have $\Enter \beta ,\sigma\simhandle\Edit s,\sims,s,\True$, and $s\sim v$ holds by definition of input simulation.
  }

  \case{\refrule{H-Update}}
  {
    By the SH-Update rule, we have $\Update l,\sigma\simhandle\Update l ,\sims[l\mapsto s],s,\True$, and $s\sim v$ holds by definition of input simulation.
   }


    \case{\refrule{H-Next}}
    {
      By the SH-Next rule, we have $t_1\Next e_2,\sigma\simhandle\overline{\simt_1'\Next e_2,\sims_1,\simi,\phi_1}\cup\overline{t_2,\sims_2,\Continue,\phi_2}$, and $\Continue \sim \Continue$ holds by definition of input simulation.
    }
    \case{\refrule{H-PassNext}}
    {
    By application of the induction hypothesis, we obtain the following.\\
    For all $t_1,\sigma,i$ such that $t_1,\sigma\handle{i}t_1',\sigma'$ there exists an $\simi\sim i$ such that $t_1,\sigma\simhandle\overline{\simt_1,\sims,\simi,\phi}$.
    From this we can conclude that there exists a symbolic execution $t_1\Next e_2,\sigma\simhandle \overline{\simt_1\Next e_2,\sims,\simi,\phi}$, and that $\simi\sim i$.
    }



  \case{\refrule{H-PassThen}}
  {
  By application of the induction hypothesis, we obtain the following.\\
  For all $t_1,\sigma,i$ such that $t_1,\sigma\handle{i}t_1',\sigma'$ there exists an $\simi\sim i$ such that $t_1,\sigma\simhandle \overline{\simt_1,\sims,\simi,\phi}$.
  From this we can conclude that there exists a symbolic execution $t_1\Then e_2,\sigma\simhandle \overline{\simt_1\Then e_2,\sims,\simi,\phi}$, and $\simi\sim i$.
  }


  \case{\refrule{H-PickLeft}}
    {
      Lemma~\ref{lem:completeNormalise} gives us the following.\\
      There exists a symbolic execution $e_1,\sigma\simnormalise \overline{\simt_1,\sims,\phi_1}$.\\
      There exists a symbolic execution $e_2,\sims\simnormalise \overline{\simt_2,\sims',\phi_2}$.

      We can now conclude that a symbolic execution exists.
      Either by the \refrule{SH-PickLeft} rule, in case $\Failing\ (\simt_2,\sims')$, or by the \refrule{SH-Pick} rule in case $\neg\Failing\ (\simt_2,\sims')$.
      We have that $\Left\sim \Left$ holds by definition.
    }
  \case{\refrule{H-PickRight}}
    {
    Lemma~\ref{lem:completeNormalise} gives us the following.\\
    There exists a symbolic execution $e_1,\sigma\simnormalise\overline{ t_1,\sims,\phi_1}$.\\
    There exists a symbolic execution $e_2,\sims\simnormalise\overline{ t_2,\sims',\phi_2}$.

    We can now conclude that a symbolic execution exists.
    Either by the \refrule{SH-PickRight} rule, in case $\Failing\ (\simt_1,\sims)$, or by the \refrule{SH-Pick} rule in case $\neg\Failing\ (t_1,\sims)$.

    We have that $\Right\sim \Right$ holds by definition.
    }

    \case{\refrule{H-FirstOr}}
    {
    By application of the induction hypothesis, we obtain the following.
    For all $t_1,\sigma,i$ such that $t_1,\sigma\handle{i}t_1',\sigma'$ there exists an $\simi\sim i$ such that $t_1,\sigma\simhandle \simt_1,\sims,\simi,\phi$.

    From \refrule{SH-Or}, and the conclusion of the induction hypothesis,
    we can conclude that there exists a symbolic input, namely $\First \simi$, such that $t_1\Or t_2,\sigma\simhandle\overline{\simt_1'\Or t_2,\sims,\First\simi,\phi}$.
    From $\simi\sim i$ and by definition of input simulation, we can conclude that $\First \simi\sim \First i$.
    }

    \case{\refrule{H-SecondOr}}
    {
    By application of the induction hypothesis, we obtain the following.
    For all $t_2,\sigma,i$ such that $t_2,\sigma\handle{i}t_2',\sigma'$ there exists an $\simi\sim i$ such that $t_2,\sigma\simhandle\simt_2,\sims,\simi,\phi$.

    From \refrule{SH-Or}, and the induction step above,
    we can conclude that there exists a symbolic input such that $t_1\Or t_2,\sigma\simhandle\overline{\simt_1\Or t_2',\sims',\Second\simi,\phi}$, namely $\Second \simi$.
    From $\simi\sim i$ and by definition of input simulation, we can conclude that $\Second \simi\sim \Second i$.
    }

    \case{\refrule{H-FirstAnd}}
    {
    By application of the induction hypothesis, we obtain the following.
    For all $t_1,\sigma,i$ such that $t_1,\sigma\handle{i}t_1',\sigma'$ there exists an $\simi\sim i$ such that $t_1,\sigma\simhandle \simt_1,\sims,\simi,\phi$.

    From \refrule{SH-And}, and the conclusion of the induction step above,
    we can conclude that there exists a symbolic input, namely $\First \simi$ such that $t_1\And t_2,\sigma\simhandle\overline{\simt_1'\And t_2,\sims,\First\simi,\phi}$.
    From $\simi\sim i$ and by definition of input simulation, we can conclude that $\First \simi\sim \First i$.
    }

    \case{\refrule{H-SecondAnd}}
    {
    By application of the induction hypothesis, we obtain the following.
    For all $t_2,\sigma,i$ such that $t_2,\sigma\handle{i}t_2',\sigma'$ there exists an $\simi\sim i$ such that $t_2,\sigma\simhandle \simt_2,\sims,\simi,\phi$.

    From \refrule{SH-And}, and the conclusion of the induction step above,
    we can conclude that there exists a symbolic input, namely $\Second \simi$ such that $t_1\And t_2,\sigma\simhandle \overline{t_1\And \simt_2,\sims,\Second\simi,\phi}$.
    From $\simi\sim i$ and by definition of input simulation, we can conclude that $\Second \simi\sim \Second i$.
    }


\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of completeness of the symbolic interaction semantics}

\begin{proof} The proof of \cref{thm:completeinteract} consists of one case, since
  the interacting semantics consists of one rule, namely\\
  \userule{I-Handle}.\\
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:completeHandle} we obtain the following.\\
  $t,\sigma\handle{i} t',\sigma'\implies \exists \simi . t,\sigma\simhandle \simt,\sims,\simi,\phi \land \simi\sim i$\\
  Then by Lemma~\ref{lem:completeNormalise} we obtain the following.\\
  $t',\sigma'\normalise t'',\sigma''\implies t',\sigma'\simnormalise \simt',\sims',\phi'$\\
  From the above, together with the SI-Handle rule, we can conclude that there exists a symbolic execution $t,\sigma\siminteract \simt'',\sims'',\simi,\phi\land \simi\sim i$.

\end{proof}

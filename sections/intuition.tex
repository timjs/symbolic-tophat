\section{TopHat}
\label{sec:intuition}

This section briefly introduces the task-oriented programming language \TOPHAT,
and discusses our vision about symbolic evaluation of this language.

The \TOPHAT\ language consists of two parts, the host language and the task language.
Programs in \TOPHAT\ are called \emph{tasks}.
The basic elements of tasks are editors.
Using combinators, tasks can be combined into larger tasks.

The task language is embedded in a simply typed lambda calculus with references, conditionals, booleans, integers, strings, pairs, lists and unary and binary operations on these types.
References allow tasks to communicate with each other, sharing information across task boundaries.
The simply typed $\lambda$-calculus does not have recursion.
By restricting references to only hold basic types,
strong normalisation of the calculus is guaranteed.
The full syntax of the host language is listed in section~\ref{sec:language}.
Next, we discuss the main constructs of the task language.


\subsection{Editors}

Editors are the most basic tasks.
They are used to communicate with the outside world.
Editors are an abstraction over widgets in a \GUI\ library or on webpage forms.
Users can change the value held by an editor, in the same way they can manipulate widgets in a \GUI.

When a \TOP\ implementation generates an application from a task specification, it derives user interfaces for the editors.
The appearance of an editor is influenced by its type.
For example, an editor for a string can be represented by a simple input field, a date by a calendar, and a location by a pin on a map.

There are three different editors in \TOPHAT.
\begin{description}
  \item[$\Edit v$] Valued editor.\\
    This editor holds a value $v$ of a certain type.
    The user can replace the value by a new value of the same type.
  \item[$\Enter \tau$] Unvalued editor.\\
    This editor holds no value, and can receive a value of type $\tau$.
    When that happens, it turns into a valued editor.
  \item[$\Update l$] Shared editor.\\
    This editor refers to a store location $l$.
    Its observable value is the value stored at that location.
    When it receives a new value, this value will be stored at location $l$.
\end{description}



\subsection{Combinators}

Editors can be combined into larger tasks using combinators.
Combinators describe the way people collaborate.
Tasks can be performed in sequence or in parallel, or there is a choice between two tasks.

The following combinators are available in \TOPHAT.
Here, $t$ stands for tasks and $e$ for arbitrary expressions.
The concrete syntax of the language is described in section~\ref{sec:expressions}
\begin{description}
  \item[$t \Then e$] Step.\\
    Users can work on task $t$.
    As soon as $t$ has a value, that value is passed on to the right hand side $e$.
    The expression $e$ is a function, taking the value as an argument, resulting in a new task.
  \item[$t \Next e$] User Step.\\
    Users can work on task $t$.
    When $t$ has a value, the step becomes enabled.
    Users can then send a continue event to the combinator.
    When that happens, the value of $t$ is passed to the right hand side, with which it continues.
  \item[$t_1 \And t_2$] Composition.\\
    Users can work on tasks $t_1$ and $t_2$ in parallel.
  \item[$t_1 \Or t_2$] Choice.\\
    The system chooses between $t_1$ or $t_2$,
    based on which task first has a value.
    If both tasks have a value, the system chooses the left one.
  \item[$e_1 \Xor e_2$] User choice.\\
    A user has to make a choice between either the left or the right hand side.
    The user continues to work on the chosen task.
\end{description}

In addition to editors and combinators, \TOPHAT\ also contains the fail task ($\Fail$).
Programmers can use this task to indicate that a task is not reachable or viable.
When the right hand side of a step combinator evaluates to $\Fail$, the step will not proceed to that task.



\subsection{Observations}

Several observations can be made on tasks.
Using the value function $\Value$, the current value of a task can be determined.
The value function is a partial function, since not all tasks have a value.
For example empty editors and steps do not have a value.

One can also observe whether or not a task is failing, by means of the failing function $\Failing$.
The task $\Fail$ is failing, as is a parallel combination of failing tasks ($\Fail \And \Fail$).

The step combinator makes use of both functions in order to determine if it can step.
First, it uses $\Value$ to see if the left hand side produces a value.
If that is the case, it uses the $\Failing$ function to see if it is safe to step to the right hand side.
The complete definition of the value and failing function are discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:observations}.



\subsection{Input}

Input events drive evaluation of tasks.
Because tasks are typed, input is typed as well.
Editors only accept input of the correct type.
Examples are replacing a value in an editor,
or sending a continue event to a user step.
When the system receives a valid event, it gives this event to the current task, which reduces to a new task.
Everything in between interaction steps is evaluated atomically with respect to inputs.
% In this way the system communicates with the environment.

Input events are synchronous, which means the order of execution is completely determined by the order of the events.
In particular, the order of input events determine the progression of parallel branches.
